# Ember JS

# Overview
Ember is an open-source JavaScript framework that allows developers to create single-page web applications. Speaking from my personal experience so far, the best feature about Ember is it’s ‘out-of-the-box’ design which allows you to easily launch and create an app pretty much immediately. It has a pluggable architecture with over 3500 addons that can be easily incorporated to enhance functionality.

# Uses MVVM, Model View ViewModel
The View Model is responsible for displaying methods, commands, and other functions that assist in maintaining the state of the View, manipulating the Model as the result of actions on the View, and triggering the events in the View itself.
Supports two-way data binding between the View and the ViewModel.
