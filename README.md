# Overview of Ember.js
Ember is an open-source JavaScript framework that allows developers to create single-page web applications. Speaking from my personal experience so far, the best feature about Ember is it’s ‘out-of-the-box’ design which allows you to easily launch and create an app pretty much immediately. It has a pluggable architecture with over 3500 addons that can be easily incorporated to enhance functionality.

# Uses MVVM, Model View ViewModel
The View Model is responsible for displaying methods, commands, and other functions that assist in maintaining the state of the View, manipulating the Model as the result of actions on the View, and triggering the events in the View itself.
Supports two-way data binding between the View and the ViewModel.

# Ember CLI:
*	‘ember new’ sets up everything you need to run an Ember application
*	Comes with a full routing story
*	Template compilation
*	Testing framework built in
*	‘ember g ____’ generates controllers, routes and models with the boilerplates associated with each
# Ember libraries:
•	No config needed
•	‘ember install ember-bootstrap’
# Companies Using Ember
•	Used by LinkedIn
•	Heroku uses it for their app dashboard
•	Apple uses it for Apple Music.
  o	Ember is being used for the Apple Music app when you go to iTunes on desktop

Testing has intimate knowledge of the framework
•	The testing framework knows about the run loop and the render loop and produces that boilerplate in your test.
